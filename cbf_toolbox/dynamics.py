class UnicycleNID(Dynamics): # NID - Near-Identity Diffeomorphism
    '''
    This class uses a "Near-Identity Diffeomorphism" to constrain
    a 2D single integrator model to behave as a unicycle.

    Unicycle dynamics can only move forward in the direction that
    the unicycle is pointing. The input to the system is v, forward
    velocity, and omega (w), angular velocity. The NID uses a trick
    to accomplish this behavior with a single integrator model.
